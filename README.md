## Description

This project is part of the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program.

I didnâ€™t have to build the game from scratch. Udacity has provided the art assets and game engine. My goal was to implement the Player and Enemy classes using Object-Oriented JavaScript.

Once finished, the game should look as show on this [video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxeHV1kt7iU&feature=youtu.be).
